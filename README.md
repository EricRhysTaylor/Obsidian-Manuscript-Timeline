## Display Requirements

This plugin creates an information-dense visualization that is more legible on high-resolution displays:
- Recommended: High-resolution displays such as Apple Retina displays or Windows equivalent (4K or better)
- The timeline contains detailed text and visual elements that benefit from higher pixel density
- While usable on standard displays, you may need to zoom in to see all details clearly

## How to Use

1. Install the plugin in your Obsidian vault
2. Configure the source path in the plugin settings to point to your scenes folder
3. Ensure your scene files have the required frontmatter metadata (see below)
4. Run the "Create Manuscript Timeline" command using the Command Palette (Cmd/Ctrl+P) to generate the visualization
5. The timeline will be created in the "Outline" folder as an HTML file
6. Open the HTML file in Obsidian using the HTML Reader plugin to view and interact with your timeline
7. To update the timeline after making changes to your scene files, run the "Create Manuscript Timeline" command again

## Required Scene Metadata

Scene files must have the following frontmatter:
- Class: Scene - Identifies the file as a scene
- When - Date of the scene (required)
- Title - Scene title
- Subplot - Subplot(s) the scene belongs to
- Act - Act number (1-3)
- Status - Scene status (Complete, Working, Todo, etc.)
- Synopsis - Brief description of the scene
- Character - Characters in the scene
- Due - Optional due date for the scene
- Edits - Optional editing notes (scenes with Edits will display with purple number boxes)
- Publish Stage - Publishing stage (Zero, Author, House, Press)

### Example Metadata

```yaml

Class: Scene
Synopsis: The protagonist discovers a mysterious artifact.

  - Celon Tim
Place:

## Timeline Visualization Elements

The timeline displays:
- Scenes arranged in a circular pattern
- Acts divided into sections
- Subplots organized in concentric rings
- Scene numbers in small boxes
- Color-coded scenes based on status
- Month markers around the perimeter
- Progress ring showing year progress

Hover over a scene to see its details and click to open the corresponding file.

## Scene Ordering and Numbering

- Scenes are ordered chronologically based on the When date in the frontmatter metadata
- The plugin parses scene numbers from the Title prefix (e.g., "1.2" in "1.2 The Discovery")
- These numbers are displayed in small boxes on the timeline
- Using numbered prefixes in your scene titles helps Obsidian order scenes correctly in the file explorer
- If scenes have the same When date, they are sub-ordered by their scene number

## Technical Implementation

The Manuscript Timeline visualization was inspired by and draws on principles from [D3.js](https://d3js.org), a powerful JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations. While the plugin doesn't directly use the D3 library to reduce dependencies, it implements several D3-style approaches:

- SVG-based visualization techniques
- Data-driven document manipulation
- Interactive elements with hover and click behaviors
- Radial layouts and polar coordinates
- Scale transformations and data mapping
- Dynamic color manipulation and pattern generation

The visualizations are built using pure SVG and JavaScript, offering a lightweight solution that maintains the elegance and interactivity of D3-style visualizations while being fully compatible with Obsidian's rendering capabilities.

## Installation

- Download the latest release
- Extract the files to your vault's `.obsidian/plugins/manuscript-timeline` folder
- Enable the plugin in Obsidian's Community Plugins settings

## Required Plugins

This plugin creates HTML files that can be viewed in Obsidian. For the best experience, you should have:

- **Core Plugins**: Make sure the "Outgoing Links" core plugin is enabled
- **Community Plugins**: The [HTML Reader](https://github.com/nuthrash/obsidian-html-plugin) plugin is recommended for viewing the generated timeline HTML files

No other plugins are required for basic functionality. The plugin uses Obsidian's native API to read frontmatter metadata from your Markdown files - Dataview is NOT required. The plugin then generates an interactive HTML timeline visualization based on this metadata.

## Development
